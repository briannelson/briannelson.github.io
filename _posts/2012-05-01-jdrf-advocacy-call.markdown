title:  "JDRF Advocacy Call"
categories: work
---

The [Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation](http://jdrf.org) <span class="sc">(jdrf)</span> relies on its volunteer advocates to get its message out to senators, representatives, and other important lawmakers.

The Advocacy Call site integrates with <span class="sc">jdrf</span>â€™s existing tools and databases to make it incredibly easy for volunteer advocates to connect with their respective congressmen and -women.

As the designer on this project, I worked with a developer and our partner at <span class="sc">jdrf</span> to conceptualize the entire site. Following <span class="sc">jdrf</span> approval, we created the project in Ruby on Rails.

Because a quick turnaround was important, we utilized [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) for our <span class="sc">ui</span> framework and customized it heavily to fit our needs and the existing <span class="sc">jdrf</span> network of sites.
