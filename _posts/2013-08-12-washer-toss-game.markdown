This is a really fast build. I was able to complete most of it during one of my daughter’s afternoon naps.

Materials list:

* <span class="sc">2</span> – <span class="sc">4′ × 16″ × 1/2″</span> sanded pine plywood
* <span class="sc">6</span> – <span class="sc">1″ × 2″ × 4′</span> pine boards
* <span class="sc">1</span> – <span class="sc">2′ × 12′</span> piece of indoor/outdoor carpet
* <span class="sc">8</span> – <span class="sc">2.5″</span> outside diameter washers

The washers are hard to find. I found some on Amazon.com and some at Tractor Supply Company. The largest washers they sell at <span class="sc">tsc</span> are the ones you want.
