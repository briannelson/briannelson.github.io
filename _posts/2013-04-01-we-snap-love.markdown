We Snap Love is more of a personal project that Iâ€™ve worked on with a developer friend of mine. My wife and I welcomed our daughter in 2012 and realized we had no easy way to share photos and videos of her with our immediate family.

We built a quick and dirty site that had easy uploading for us and simple access for our sometimes technically challenged relatives.

We Snap Love is built in Ruby on Rails.
