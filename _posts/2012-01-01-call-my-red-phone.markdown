Call My Red Phone <span class="sc">(cmrp)</span> was a conceptual project built on the excellent [Twilio](http://twilio.com) platform. A user could create a temporary or permanent vanity phone number very quickly and easily and then associate a custom “flow” to be initiated when the number was dialed.

As one half of the two-man team that created this project, I was responsible for a lot of the early conceptualization, as well as the final logo, illustrations, and visual work on the site.

<span class="sc">cmrp</span> was built in Ruby on Rails and was sold at the end of 2012.
