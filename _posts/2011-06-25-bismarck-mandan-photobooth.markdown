Having a photobooth at your wedding is all the rage these days. My wife and I jumped on board that train, but decided that building our own would be a lot more fun than renting one!

The photobooth was designed to fit in with our Jazz Age/Art Deco “theme”.

After the photobooth was built, I created the marketing page and was able to provide photobooth services to the Bismarck/Mandan area.
