A good friend of mine who works at [GitHub](http://github.com) hooked me up with another Hubber, [Andrew Nesbitt](http://twitter.com/teabass). He had leveraged the GitHub <span class="sc">api</span> to look up any GitHub user's first pull request.

I came in to add a design and some polish. It was a fun weekend project and we're pretty thrilled at how it turned out (and the response we've gotten).

Check out the [live site](http://firstpr.me), especially if you're a frequent GitHub user.

A special thanks goes to [Matt DuVall](http://mattduvall.com/) who's doing a wonderful job re-creating some animations that were originally found in [Stripe's](http://stripe.com) new checkout process.
