I recently spent a little time helping out GitHub's [Andrew Nesbitt](http://twitter.com/teabass) with [First PR](http://firstpr.me). I think I probably spent less than 10 hours on the project so far, but the response has been very positive.

I commented to my friend that it's (a little) sad that a project I've spent so little time on has become the most talked about thing I've done. His response was pretty smart:

### "I think the lesson here is how to figure out the Nugget of Awesome and only deal with that."

He was completely right, too.

## What **is** a Nugget of Awesome?

In this case, I think there are a few **Nuggets** and they are different for different people.

Inspired in no small way by Twitter's [first tweet](https://discover.twitter.com/first-tweet) campaign, the point of this site is that there is really no point, besides nostalgia. It serves no greater purpose, and doesn't really allow you to accomplish anything, but it's fun and fast and people like it.

For some people, the bare HTML with no design would have been the nugget. They just wanted the data at the end.

For others, (myself included) the Nugget is the little animation that occurs to deliver your data.

It's a little unexpected and delights the user. Nuggets are experiences, or interactions that make a lasting impression in a person's mind.

## Why are Nuggets of Awesome important?

There are things I dread doing online. Many of them are activities that are boring, or as I like to describe them, sterile. There's nothing particularly wrong with these interactions. They've been coded properly, they work, etc. But I never feel **rewarded** as I use the app or site.

[MailChimp](httpe://mailchimp.com), on the other hand, has famously built its brand on an engaging and fun user experience. People are using MailChimp to accompish Real Business Tasks&trade; but they're actually enjoying it!

That's because MailChimp has spent a lot of time figuring out what the Nuggets are in every single interaction. They've done an amazing job making pretty mundane actions (sending an email) fun and easy.

From a business perspective, this is brilliant. It keeps people using their site, and it interests prospective customers as well.

## How do I make Nuggets of Awesome in my own work?

One important thing to remember about a Nugget of Awesome is that it's completely subjective. One user might **love** the little flap animation we're using, and another might think it's the worst thing they've ever seen.

My point is, you won't be able to please everyone, but chances are, if you enjoy using something you've created, others will too.

That said, it can be daunting to try and add these enjoyable experiences to a large project. So my advice is this: **start small**. Try and incorporate little things here and there that help or delight the person using your software.

For some really great examples, check out [Little Big Details](http://littlebigdetails.com/). They explain their purpose with a quote from Dieter Rams: **“Good design is thorough down to the last detail”**.
